								<h2>What is Quebec Coin?</h2>
								
							</header>
							<p>Quebecoin was launched in April 2014 and has gained a reputation for resilience as cryptocurrency. Crypto overcame all obstacles and survived. Thanks to a dedicated community that has seen its potential. In 2019, Quebec made the headlines as the best place in the world to establish cryptocurrency miners, which drew attention to Quebecoin. A new generation of community members is joining our efforts to rejuvenate and promote this crypto to new cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
